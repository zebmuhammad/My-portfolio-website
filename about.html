            <p>I'm Muhammad Zeb — a web developer and Computer Science student based in Peshawar. I craft responsive, accessible, and visually engaging websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm building my full-stack skills with Node.js and MongoDB. I enjoy combining clean UI, thoughtful UX, and performance-focused code to create sites that look great and feel fast. I'm also exploring AI integrations and graphic design to make smarter, more polished products. Currently I'm open to collaboration and freelance projects — let's build something that people enjoy using.</p>
